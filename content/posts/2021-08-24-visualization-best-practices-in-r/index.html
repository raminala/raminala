<h2>1-2 Familiarizing with disease data</h2>
<p>The dataset containing disease cases from the World Health Organization (WHO) is loaded into your environment as the dataframe who_disease.</p>
<p>In order to familiarize yourself with the data, let’s start by printing it to the console.</p>
<p>Once you’ve investigated it a bit, make a simple bar chart of the number of observations by region using the supplied code. You will need to fill in the aes()thetics function to map the x-axis to the proper column name.</p>
<p>This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Tidyverse Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!</p>

<h2>1-3 Warming up data-wrangling</h2>
<p>Let’s warm up your tidyverse data wrangling skills a bit and look at the number of cases reported by year for the American region (‘AMR’).</p>
<p>To do this, we will first filter the dataset to our desired region, then make a simple scatter plot of the year by cases.</p>
<p>In addition, set the opacity of the points to 50% (0.5) so we can get a sense of data overlap.</p>

<div id="the-infamous-p-i-e" class="section level2">
<h2>1-5 The infamous P-I-E</h2>
<p>Intuitively, you can think about a pie chart as a stacked bar chart that has been ‘wrapped’ around some central axis. Conveniently, this intuition fits very well with how they are made in ggplot2.</p>
<p>Supplied is code to summarize our who_disease data into a dataframe containing three diseases: measles, mumps, and,other, along with their total number of cases in the data.</p>
<p>Your job is to turn the empty ggplot object into a stacked bar-chart, then into a pie-chart by using the transform coord_polar(theta = ‘y’).</p>
<p>Notice how I have set x = 1 in the aesthetics. This is because we only want one bar chart here. We’ll learn about multiple stacked bar charts in the next lesson!</p>

<h2>1-7 How about a waffle?</h2>
<p>What if we are interested in the details of the ‘other’ class?</p>
<p>Let’s make the switch to a waffle chart, as they are capable of dealing with more classes. We’ll use the same data-manipulation pipeline from the last exercise, but this time with all the diseases left in.</p>
<p>We will use the library waffle which contains the function waffle(). This function produces a waffle chart for you when supplied with a named vector of counts.</p>
<p>It will draw one square for each unit supplied in the vector, so we need to manipulate our disease counts to rounded percents (note the mutate() call in the supplied data wrangling code).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>disease_counts &lt;- who_disease %&gt;%

<div id="basic-stacked-bars" class="section level2">
<h2>1-9 Basic stacked bars</h2>
<p>When we made the pie and waffle charts in the last exercises, we looked at all years in the data combined together.</p>
<p>Now, we’re interested in looking at these patterns over time. To do this we will make a stacked bar chart with the x-axis being the year of observation. Like we did with the pie chart before, we will simplify the data to just be measles, mumps, and other.</p>
<p>Do you notice anything funky in the data after visualizing it this way?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>disease_counts &lt;- who_disease %&gt;%
    mutate(disease = ifelse(disease %in% c(&#39;measles&#39;, &#39;mumps&#39;), disease, &#39;other&#39;)) %&gt;%
    group_by(disease, year) %&gt;% # note the addition of year to the grouping.
    summarise(total_cases = sum(cases))

# add the mapping of year to the x axis.

</div>
<div id="ordering-stack-for-readability" class="section level2">
<h2>1-10 Ordering stack for readability</h2>
<p>In the last plot since we grouped all diseases that are not measles and mumps into their own category, it’s fair to assume that we care less about the ‘other’ category’s trajectory than those of measles and mumps.</p>
<p>Because of this, the plot we made has a problem. The way that the bars are stacked, with measles on top, mumps in the middle, and other on the bottom, makes it hard to get a good intuition for the behavior of mumps over time because its baseline is non-constant due to changing values in measles proportions.</p>
<p>Ggplot orders the bars and legend based upon the order it sees the variables in the dataset. To override this, turn the disease column into a factor with the levels in the order we want our plot to use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>disease_counts &lt;- who_disease %&gt;%
    mutate(
        disease = ifelse(disease %in% c(&#39;measles&#39;, &#39;mumps&#39;), disease, &#39;other&#39;) %&gt;% 
        factor(levels = c(&#39;measles&#39;, &#39;other&#39;, &#39;mumps&#39;)) # change factor levels to desired ordering

<div id="categorical-x-axis" class="section level2">
<h2>1-11 Categorical x-axis</h2>
<p>In the previous charts, we saw that mumps didn’t start getting reported until 1999, making comparisons before then meaningless.</p>
<p>Let’s filter the data to be only the cases reported on or after 1999 and then make a stacked bar chart looking at the proportion of different diseases by region.</p>
<p>Modify the data-manipulation pipeline to get the data into the form you want, then build your stacked bar chart and plot! Don’t worry about ordering the bars here as we did in the last exercise. See any surprising patterns?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>disease_counts &lt;- who_disease %&gt;%
    # Filter to on or later than 1999
    filter(year &gt;= 1999) %&gt;%

    summarise(total_cases = sum(cases))

# Set aesthetics so disease is the stacking variable, region is the x-axis and counts are the y

<div id="working-with-geom_col" class="section level2">
<h2>2-3 Working with geom_col</h2>
<p>In ggplot, there are two different ways to make bar plots: geom_col() and geom_bar().</p>
<p>If your data is in the form where the height of the bar is encoded in a column that you want to map to the y-axis, like counts of diseases are in our data, you want to use the geom_col() option.</p>
<p>Let’s make a barplot of the number of cases recorded by disease for India in 1980 using geom_col().</p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_disease %&gt;% 
    # filter to india in 1980
    filter(country==&quot;India&quot;, year == 1980) %&gt;% 
    # map x aesthetic to disease and y to cases
    ggplot(aes(disease, cases)) +
    # use geom_col to draw
    geom_col()</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="wrangling-geom_bar" class="section level2">
<h2>2-4 Wrangling geom_bar</h2>
<p>Whereas geom_col() expects you to pass it a y-axis mapping column, geom_bar() doesn’t take a y-axis call (at least by default).</p>
<p>Instead, geom_bar() takes your x-axis mapping and counts every single observation (or row of the passed dataframe) for each class and then draws bars of corresponding heights</p>
<p>These two code chunks will give you the same plot:</p>
</div>
<div id="geom_col" class="section level1">

<p>data %&gt;%
groupby(xAxisCol) %&gt;%
summarize(value = n()) %&gt;%

</div>
<div id="geom_bar" class="section level1">
<h1>geom_bar()</h1>
<p>data %&gt;%
ggplot(aes(x = xAxisCol)) +

Let’s use geom_bar() to make a look at observations with a large number of cases by region our WHO data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_disease %&gt;%
    # filter data to observations of greater than 1,000 cases
    filter(cases &gt; 1000) %&gt;%
    # map the x-axis to the region column
    ggplot(aes(region)) +
    # add a geom_bar call

<div id="ordered-point-chart" class="section level2">
<h2>2-6 Ordered point chart</h2>
<p>Let’s start by improving the point plot we saw in the slides.</p>
<p>First, change the data manipulation pipeline to filter to the years 1992 and 2002 instead of the default 2006-2016. Note that the array interestingCountries has been loaded and is the same as in the slides.</p>
<p>Now modify the plotting code to plot the new data, but this time, let’s reorder the y-axis in descending order of cases for 1992.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>interestingCountries &lt;- c(&quot;NGA&quot;, &quot;SDN&quot;, &quot;FRA&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot;, &quot;MYS&quot;, &quot;TZA&quot;, &quot;YEM&quot;, &quot;UKR&quot;, &quot;BGD&quot;, &quot;VNM&quot;)

    ) %&gt;% 
    mutate(year = paste0(&#39;cases_&#39;, year)) %&gt;% 
    spread(year, cases)
 
# Reorder y axis and change the cases year to 1992

</div>
<div id="adding-visual-anchors" class="section level2">
<h2>2-7 Adding visual anchors</h2>
<p>A nice property of the log fold change is it is symmetric: a value of 1 means two times ‘bigger’, and -1 means two times ‘smaller.’ Due to this, the position of 0 on the x-axis marks the switch point between count declines and increases over years. When your data has a natural break-point like this, it is good if the chart shows it as a focal-point as well.</p>
<p>The code provided will make a basic point chart of the log fold change for the dates. To improve it, we will do two things. First, reorder the dots in descending order like in the previous exercise. Second, add a guideline at x = 0 to show the neutral point by adding geom_vline() (for verticalline) to your plot object with the argument xintercept set to 0.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_subset %&gt;% 
    # calculate the log fold change between 2002 and 1992

<h2>2-8 Faceting to show structure.</h2>
<p>Taking the code from the last exercise, let’s modify it to group the countries by their region by faceting.</p>
<p>This will help inject a bit more structure into the presentation while not overly complicating the chart.</p>
<p>We want to use facet_grid() here and keep all the plots in the same column, enabling easy comparisons outside of a region while still maintaining the region-level grouping.</p>
<p>You will also need to adjust the scale argument in facet_grid() in order to avoid repeating the entire y-axis structure for every facet.</p>

<h2>2-12 Converting to point chart</h2>
<p>Our plot in the last exercise looked good, but what if we care about the values of the lower-end of the cases? It’s hard for us to get a sense of their values because Brazil and Argentina are forcing the axis’ upper range so high.</p>
<p>This is a good situation to switch to a log scale. However, remember that when on a log scale our stacking concept fails, so we should switch to a point chart! Note the additional filter added to the pipeline. What happens if you run the code without it?</p>
<p>This time, instead of modifying the data before sending to ggplot(), we will add scale_y_log10() to our plot and ggplot will take care of it for us.</p>

<h2>3-4 Changing y-axis to density</h2>
<p>By default, you will notice that the y-axis is the ‘count’ of points that fell within a given bin. This is nice and interpretable, but what if we wanted to interpret the plot as a true density curve like it’s trying to estimate? I.e. all the (bar widths) * (bar heights) sum to 1?</p>
<p>To do this we simply add y = stat(density) to the aesthetic mappings, this will re-scale the y-axis from counts to an empirical probability estimate. Note this won’t change the shape of the plot at all, but will simply give you a different interpretation of the y-axis.</p>

<p>Edit the plot to have 100 bins instead of 40 and also change the color of the bars to ‘steelblue’ just because it’s a good color and sometimes that’s important.</p>

<h2>3-8 Bin width by context</h2>
<p>The supplied code looks at the distribution of citations by hour of the day. Notice how the bars don’t fall nicely on a given hour; making the interpretation of the bar heights a bit ungainly. When your data has natural breakpoints like this, you should exploit them. In this case, we can set our breaks to fall on the hour boundaries.</p>
<p>Modify geom_histogram() to set the binwidth to 1 hour. This argument, however, doesn’t tell ggplot where to start its bins, which by default is determined by the extent of the data. To fix this, set the center argument to 0.5. This says you want one of the bars to be centered at 30 mins past midnight, ggplot then arranges the rest of the bars accordingly. (You could set this to be any hour + 0.5 such as 2.5, 3.5 etc..)</p>
