<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (based on phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. This really is a <strong>supervised question</strong> because it has an outcome (y), which defined as if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed, “yes” means subscribed, and “no” means did not subscribe. This dataset consists of <strong>4521 observations</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to the outcome classification variable, there are 16 variables. Eight variables are related to statistical information about current and previous campaigns, and they seems irrelevant to dependent variable. So, there are eight determinent variables Including:</p>
<p>Customer’s <strong><em>age</em></strong> and <strong><em>balance</em></strong> (numerical variables),</p>
<p>Customer’s <strong><em>job</em></strong>, <strong><em>marital</em></strong> status, <strong><em>education</em></strong> (categorical variables)</p>
<p><strong><em>housing loan</em></strong>, <strong><em>personal loan</em></strong>, and <strong><em>default status</em></strong> (binary variables)</p>
<p>Information regarding the reference of dataset is available at:</p>

<div id="age" class="section level2">
<h2><em>age</em></h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 6
##   minimum    q1 median  mean    q3 maximum
##     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      19    33     39  41.2    49      87</code></pre>
<p>Above plot and table give an impression on the age of examined group. The minimum, maximum and average ages are 19, 87, and 41 years respectively. Majority of observations are concentrated at the age of between 30 to 35 years. This information would not provide any insight on the possible outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="balance" class="section level2">
<h2><em>balance</em></h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 6

## 1   -3313    69    444 1423.  1480   71188</code></pre>
<p>Balance is generally between 0 to $500, however, amounts as high as $71000 is available in data. In the above plot, Only range from $-4000 to $10000 is shown for a better depiction. In this case, mean (1422) is higher than median (444) and plor looks right-skewed.</p>

<h2>Univariate Analysis of some catagorical variables</h2>

<div id="subscription-status" class="section level2">
<h2><em>subscription status</em></h2>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 3
## # Groups:   y [2]
##   y         n percentage
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 no     4000       88.5
## 2 yes     521       11.5</code></pre>
<p>This univariate analysis could give a clue about probability of subscription in customers. from the above table, it is obvious that magority of customers did not subscribed (88.476%) comparing slighly more than ten percent of customers who finally choose to subscribe (11.524%). The good point about dataset is it provided valid outcome for all customers (whether subscribed or not).</p>
</div>
<div id="bivariate-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Bivariate Analysis</h2>
<p>In this part two variables are considering and their relationship are examined. A dummy variable has been defined for outcome so that</p>
<p>0=No (did not subscribed), and</p>
<p>1=yes (subscribed).</p>
</div>
<div id="corrolation-between-age-and-balance" class="section level2">
<h2>Corrolation between age and balance</h2>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Corrolation between age and balance:  0.0838201422447776&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It shows small positive corrolation between age and balance. generally older clients tends to have higher balamce but the corrolation is more like a random relation because it is more close to zero (random case) than 1 (strong corrolation).</p>
<p><em>subscription status~job</em></p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There are twelve categories of jobs.Managements, blue-collars, and technicians are the most frequent jobs among respondents. As shown in the plot, among these jobs, managements are more likely to subscribe. However, relative number of subscription is very high among students, unknown and unemployed people. These groups are more likely to subscribe.</p>
</div>
<div id="subscription-statusmarital" class="section level2">
<h2><em>subscription status~marital</em></h2>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4
## # Groups:   marital, subscription_status [6]
##   marital  subscription_status     n percent
##   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
## 1 divorced                   0   451     451
## 2 divorced                   1    77      77
## 3 married                    0  2520    2520
## 4 married                    1   277     277

<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Similar to previous analysis could be done for marital status.This plot shows majority of respondents are married. However, divorced group are more likely to subscribe when numbers compared in each group.</p>
</div>
<div id="subscription-statusbalance" class="section level2">
<h2><em>subscription status~balance</em></h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In this plot, subscription status versus balance depicted. Very high balances (higher than $30000) considered as outlier data and they have been omitted from plotting. Considering this plot alone is not very informative for me. I barely could decide if higher balance increase/decrease the chance of subscription by looking at this plot. For this reason, a Generalized linear line added to plot for a better information.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The added layer to this plot, comparing the previous plot, shows that those who has higher balance are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. But how strong is this relationship? In other word, is balance very determinant parameter? Let’s perform generalized analysis and see the parameters.</p>

<div id="subscription-statusage" class="section level2">
<h2><em>subscription status~age</em></h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Again it looks difficult to get information from this plot as they have not strong relation. However, blue line that is the generalized regression line, shows that higher age people tends to subscribe more. An important subject to remember is in a multi variable problem, considering one parameter alone could be misleading because of corrolation of variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="subscription-statusdefault" class="section level2">
<h2><em>subscription status~default</em></h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In this plot combination of two categorical variables are counted. One is default and the other is dependent variable (result). We have four categories here (four possible combinations for two binary variables). It seems that default clients (default=yes) is very unlikely to subscribe.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-of-three-variables-result-versus-age-and-balance" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis of three variables: result versus age and balance</h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" />
This plot consists of two numerical variables (age and balance) that both are explanatory variables and response variable which depicted by color (pink colors did not subscribed and blue colours subscribed).</p>
