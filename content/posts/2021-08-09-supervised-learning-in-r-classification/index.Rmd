```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(class) #knn
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
signs <- read_csv("signs.csv") #%>% na.omit()
next_sign <- read_csv("next_sign.csv")
#glimpse(signs)
where9am <- read_csv("where9am.csv")
```
## 1-2

```{r}
# Load the 'class' package
library(class)

# Create a vector of labels
sign_types <- signs$sign_type

# Classify the next sign observed
ss<-knn(train = signs[-1], test = next_sign, cl = sign_types)
```
## 1-4

```{r}
# Examine the structure of the signs dataset

str(signs)
# Count the number of signs of each type
table(signs$sign_type)

# Check r10's average red level by sign type
aggregate(r10 ~ sign_type, data = signs, mean)
```


## 1-8 Testing other 'k' values

By default, the knn() function in the class package uses only the single nearest neighbor.

Setting a k parameter allows the algorithm to consider additional nearby neighbors. This enlarges the collection of neighbors which will vote on the predicted class.

Compare k values of 1, 7, and 15 to examine the impact on traffic sign classification accuracy.

The class package is already loaded in your workspace along with the datasets signs, signs_test, and sign_types. The object signs_actual holds the true values of the signs.


## 2-2- Computing probabilities
The where9am data frame contains 91 days (thirteen weeks) worth of data in which Brett recorded his location at 9am each day as well as whether the daytype was a weekend or weekday.

Using the conditional probability formula below, you can compute the probability that Brett is working in the office, given that it is a weekday.

```{r}
# Compute P(A) 
p_A <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(B)
p_B <- nrow(subset(where9am, daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute the observed P(A and B)
p_AB <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office" & daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(A | B) and print its value
p_A_given_B <- p_AB / p_B
p_A_given_B
```

## 2-4- A simple Naive Bayes location model

The previous exercises showed that the probability that Brett is at work or at home at 9am is highly dependent on whether it is the weekend or a weekday.

To see this finding in action, use the where9am data frame to build a Naive Bayes model on the same data.

You can then use this model to predict the future: where does the model think that Brett will be at 9am on Thursday and at 9am on Saturday?

The data frame where9am is available in your workspace. This dataset contains information about Brett's location at 9am on different days.

```{r}

thursday9am <- data.frame(daytype=c("weekday"))
saturday9am <- data.frame(daytype=c("weekend"))
# Load the naivebayes package
library(naivebayes)

# Build the location prediction model
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype, data = where9am)

# Predict Thursday's 9am location
predict(locmodel, thursday9am)

# Predict Saturdays's 9am location
predict(locmodel, saturday9am)
```

## 2-5- Examining "raw" probabilities

The naivebayes package offers several ways to peek inside a Naive Bayes model.

Typing the name of the model object provides the a priori (overall) and conditional probabilities of each of the model's predictors. If one were so inclined, you might use these for calculating posterior (predicted) probabilities by hand.

Alternatively, R will compute the posterior probabilities for you if the type = "prob" parameter is supplied to the predict() function.

Using these methods, examine how the model's predicted 9am location probability varies from day-to-day. The model locmodel that you fit in the previous exercise is in your workspace.

```{r}
# The 'naivebayes' package is loaded into the workspace
# and the Naive Bayes 'locmodel' has been built

# Examine the location prediction model
locmodel

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am
predict(locmodel, thursday9am , type = "prob")

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am
predict(locmodel, saturday9am , type = "prob")
```

## 2-9- A more sophisticated location model

The locations dataset records Brett's location every hour for 13 weeks. Each hour, the tracking information includes the daytype (weekend or weekday) as well as the hourtype (morning, afternoon, evening, or night).

Using this data, build a more sophisticated model to see how Brett's predicted location not only varies by the day of week but also by the time of day. The dataset locations is already loaded in your workspace.

You can specify additional independent variables in your formula using the + sign (e.g. y ~ x + b).

```{r}
# The 'naivebayes' package is loaded into the workspace already

# Build a NB model of location
#locmodel <- naive_bayes(location  ~ daytype + hourtype, locations)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday afternoon
#predict(locmodel, weekday_afternoon)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday evening
#predict(locmodel, weekday_evening)
```

##2-10-Preparing for unforeseen circumstances

While Brett was tracking his location over 13 weeks, he never went into the office during the weekend. Consequently, the joint probability of P(office and weekend) = 0.

Explore how this impacts the predicted probability that Brett may go to work on the weekend in the future. Additionally, you can see how using the Laplace correction will allow a small chance for these types of unforeseen circumstances.

The model locmodel is already in your workspace, along with the dataframe weekend_afternoon.
