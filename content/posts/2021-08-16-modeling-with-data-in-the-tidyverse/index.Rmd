## 1-1 Log10 transformation of house size

You just saw that the predictor variable sqft_living is right-skewed and hence a log base 10 transformation is warranted to unskew it. Just as we transformed the outcome variable price to create log10_price in the video, let's do the same for sqft_living.

```{r}

# Plot the histogram
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = sqft_living)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(x="Size (sq.feet)", y="count")
```


```{r}
# Add log10_size
house_prices_2 <- house_prices %>%
  mutate(log10_size = log10(sqft_living))

# Plot the histogram  
ggplot(house_prices_2, aes(x = log10_size)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "log10 size", y = "count")
```
