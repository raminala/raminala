 My name is Ramin Ala. I am a PhD student at the University of New Brunswick and my research is on Harmonic Radar and its application. Before starting my degree I worked as Electrical engineer for seven years in the area of Radio frequency, Antenna and passive microwave circuits.
 
 I recently started learning data science and Machine learning. I started with learning R and Python and different libraries of them. Although I am very interested in this area, I don't look at this as a hobby and I will try to make myself competent to take a position in this area.
